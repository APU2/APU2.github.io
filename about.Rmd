## Project outline

Rapid gravity filters are the final physical barrier in many water treatment systems
preventing pathogens and particulate contaminants from reaching the distribution
system and customer. These long life assets are typically monitored using on-line
turbidity, flow and head loss instrumentation. New methods for monitoring
modelling and optimising particle systems as well as software for converting big datasets into useful insights to evidence operational decisions are being
developed to allow existing physical assets to deliver improving levels of water
quality compliance.
