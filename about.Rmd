# Project outline

Rapid gravity filters are the final physical barrier in many water treatment systems preventing pathogens and particulate contaminants from reaching the distribution system and customer. These long life assets are typically monitored using on-line turbidity, flow and head loss instrumentation. New methods for monitoring modelling and optimising particle systems as well as software for converting process data into useful insights to evidence operational decisions are being developed to allow existing physical assets to deliver improving levels of water quality compliance.
